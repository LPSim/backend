## [0.4.2.3] - 2023-12-03

### Added
- `get_class_by_base_class` for `ClassRegistry`, which can get all classes 
  that are inherited from the base class.
- Before using a card, card usage will be checked by `UseCardValue`, which can
  mark a card failed to use.
- Added `/deck_code_data` endpoint in HTTPServer, which can get deck code data
  from server, and frontend can generate deck code without asking server.
- Now default_version will be recorded in `Deck`. If not specified, it is 
  `None`.
- Now `/log` in `HTTPServer` will log match_config.
- `AttackAndGenerateStatusSummonBase` is added for summons perform like Dehya's
  Elemental Skill summon, which will generate status at each round, and when it
  is removed, the corresponding status will also be removed.
- `CreateStatusPassiveSkill` is implemented for charactors that will generate
  status when they are created. 
- Now costs of cards and skills will be recorded in `desc_registry`, and passed
  to frontend by `/patch` in `HTTPServer`.

### Fixed
- wrong description of Gambler's Earrings with version 3.3.
- Typo of error message in class_registry.
- When deck code contains unknown card number, it will raise error. After 
  fixing this, it will ignore unknown card number.
- RoundEffectSupports, e.g. Paimon, NRE, is not inherited from its 
  corresponding base class (e.g. CompanionBase, ItemBase).
- Wrong cost of Joyous Celebration.
- Charactors that has status created at game start, e.g. Raiden Shogun, will 
  not gain the status when revive. Now they will inherit 
  `CreateStatusPassiveSkill` to gain the status and handle revive actions.
- When charactor is stunned (e.g. Frozen), it can still use skill by equipping
  Skill Talent cards.
- Targtaglia will accidently increase additional damage caused by elemental
  reaction, e.g. Electro-Charged.
- Wrong charactor order when triggering events. Previously is active charactor
  then left first; now is active charactor then next first.
- Can switch to current active charactor from current active charactor in 
  `Match`, though no cards or skills can trigger it now.
- #12 When summon triggers other events that will stack self, e.g. Burning
  Flame, if it is currently in max usage, it still keeps max usage after 
  attacking. This is fixed by using `ChangeObjectUsageAction` instead of 
  modifying its usage by itself directly.

# Changed
- Move template files to `templates` folder.
- Define `AllCharactorFoodCard` for foods that will effect all charactors.
- Now `CostLabels` contains `EQUIPMENT` and `EVENT` enum, to represent 
  equipments (Weapons, Artifacts, most Talent cards) and event cards (Most
  normal event cards, Arcane-legend cards, and some talents).
- New `FactionType` is added for future charactors.
- `ChangeUsageAction` removes `change_type`, it only supports change type of
  `DELTA` now.

### Added
- #4 #5 #9 Implement class registry, which supports registering class by name 
  and getting class by name. It also supports registering classes after lpsim 
  is initialized.
- #13 Implement desc registry, which saves the descriptions of classes. When a 
  class is registered in the class registry, a valid description is required.
- Implement `/patch` endpoint in HTTPServer, which can be used to get 
  description patchs from server.
- #3 Support create `Deck` from deck code, or export `Deck` to deck code.
  Also add related APIs in HTTPServer.

### Changed
- Now `desc` for a class means description hints for the class, e.g. with 
  talent activated, descriptions of some class will change. `desc` is a Literal
  now and default contains empty string. If a class has hints, add more strings
  into it, and modify `desc` when situation matchs. When `desc` is set, its
  corresponding descriptions should also be valid. Refer to Sucrose's Large
  Wind Spirit and desc_class for more details.
- #6 Now HTTPServer will send detailed error about deck in `/deck` when deck is 
  invalid.
